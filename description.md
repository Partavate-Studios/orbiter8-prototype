Orbiter 8 is a game dapp written for the Ethereum blockchain. 

Bitcoin instigated a revolution in technology leading to the proliferation of derivative innovative new platforms. Many people believe this technology to be important to improving lives all around the world by making money work better for more people and in more equitable ways. However, the paradigms are a significant departure from today’s social models for money. This barrier to entry makes user adoption for these new platforms challenging in markets that would otherwise benefit from blockchain based solutions.

Gaming is an industry with a unique advantage in emerging technologies. Gaming allows us to play and playing allows us to develop and learn. Gaming has evolved through history, seemingly there as far back as we can look with what evidence we’ve found left behind. More recently, gaming not only evolved with recent technology, it played a key role in driving the adoption of, first, the personal computer industry and then, the Internet. Be it insight or delusion, there exists a small but ever increasing list of “blockchain games” announced by studios big and small.

Orbiter 8 looks to join the effort by creating an engaging gaming experience on the Ethereum platform. Orbiter 8 is designed to be unique, simple yet stylish, and casual. Here’s what sets it apart:

Blockchain Centric World: Where many games seek to touch the blockchain lightly, such as tokenizing goods in an online game world, all Orbiter 8’s core gameplay runs on the blockchain as a dapp at the core. Standing out from the more popular casino and trading card dapps, Orbiter 8 is a turn-based game played at a casual pace in a massively multiplayer near-future gameworld. 

Simple and Stylish: Rather than competing with big studio graphics, Orbiter 8’s interface is designed to be lightweight, accessible, and visually compelling. The game client that interfaces with the gamer’s Ethereum wallet and the Ethereum network will be pure javascript (including game art) and should run in most Web browsers.

Casual Gameplay: The opposite of a twitch game, gamers will thoughtfully consider each option before paying to commit their next turn to the network. In Orbiter 8, gamers will fly to distant stars, trade, battle, and build empires at a pace that might feel something like a game of chess.
